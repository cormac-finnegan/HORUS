<h1>Overview</h1>
Although there are no official records it is estimated that on the 640 million acres of federally owned land in the United States there are over 1600 missing people who’s cases have long gone cold. The vast majority of federally owned land in the United States belonging to the National Park Service and Forest Service meaning that campers often go missing regularly in the country’s vast wilderness and are never found. Between 2007 and 2013 1025 people died overall between the 59 National Parks meaning the average number of fatalities year by year is 160 [1]. 
The goal of this project to implement a Single Page Application that acts as a front-end to a theoretical tracking system which is given to campers and hikers when signing in to use the National Park. The Tacking device utilizes a heavy duty, low-power disk which can act as a GPS beacon when connected to one of the many cell towers scattered across the national parks. This system could greatly reduce the time Park Rangers and Search and Rescue Officers spend looking for missing people, thus increasing the likelihood they’ll find the missing person alive. 
Aims
As previously stated the goal of the application is to create a front-end for a hypothetical tracking system for visitors to one of the United States national parks. I have chosen the Grand Canyon National Park located in Arizona which is one of the most popular and iconic destinations for hikers and campers. Being so popular the park also as one of the highest numbers of fatalities with about 12 a year from this park alone. 
The application will assist the Park Rangers and Search and Rescue Officers by providing a real-time map of the park and GPS coordinates of the hypothetical GPS trackers that are provided to visitors when they enter the park. Although there are issues associated with the real world application of such a system, mostly with how to transmit the GPS coordinates without cellular data, the goal of this project is to only provide the interface that employees and law enforcement will use providing such a system already exists. 
The system consists of four users: 
    1. Admin – Has access to employee records and has full CRUD functionality. The admin also has access to a list off all physical tools that the system uses such as the trackers and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles used by the system. 
    2. National Park Rangers (NPR) – The primary users of the system, they are employed by the park full time and operate the day to day activities along with the registering of visitors, assigning a tracker to a visitor, updating details of visitors, and access to the real time tracking map 
    3. Visitors – The visitor to the park. The tracking device is given to the visitors when they arrive at the park and are asked for details from the National Park Rangers to be registered. The visitor also has an option to engage a distress signal on the device to alert the authorities that they are in need of distress. They are also able to view their statistics collected by the tracker when they return the device and can also request that the data be sent to their email address provided when registering.
    4. Search and Rescue Officers (SAR) – The most important user of the system, but hopefully the least used. The Search and Rescue Officers have more in depth access to the location data of the deployed trackers, able to see all of the current locations on the real-time map, the location history of all currently deployed trackers on the map, and the ability to search for a tracker by the name of the missing person. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the application is to make locating visitors as easy and fast as possible, however these metrics need to be quantified. Due to the nature of the technology being used it’s important to minimize the power used by the deployed trackers. So there needs to be an efficient polling time period for requesting GPS data from the trackers. Therefore normal polling times will be every 60 minutes with an emergency mode that can be engaged by Search and Rescue to poll every 30 minutes or every 15 minutes. 
To address the non-functional requirement of having the interface “easy to use”, I have decided that it would be productive to keep the interface consistent across multiple users. For example, both the NPR’s and SAR’s have access to the real time tracking map functionality with the SAR’s having the additional benefit of viewing the history. Therefore using a mixture of Angular js and Google Maps to provide the functionality of both and limiting the history functionality to just the SAR user type using Angular[2]. Another tool for providing an easy to use application is the use of Bootstrap which provides a consistent look and feel across the entire application. 
As the application will focus on the real-time tracking of the visitors using a Google Maps, it’s important to ensure the entire software stack is optimized for the best performance for real-time events. Nodejs has that advantage over other languages for server side as Nodejs is event driven. Nodejs is regarded as one of the most efficient performance wise for real-time data access, often being used in chat applications. One of the many reasons for this over another server side application written in Java for example is that Nodejs deals only with JSON. When Java interacts with the server it has a tendency to want to convert everything into a Java Object, which in real time applications can add some latency[3]. While Nodejs uses JSON natively it doesn’t have to deal with parsing results, considering how ubiquitous JSON is has led many to make the switch for their server side application. 
For the development of this project I want to strictly adhere to Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development paradigms as a primary objective. As I am not working with a team this time I want to experiment with how strictly I can adhere to utilizing the two development frameworks. As the system is dealing with a mixture of Realtime software, power limitations, and life or death situations it’s imperative that the software have as few bugs as possible. Using automated testing tools is a must and research into perhaps implementing a continuous build delivery system would be a help to ensure that tests always pass.
